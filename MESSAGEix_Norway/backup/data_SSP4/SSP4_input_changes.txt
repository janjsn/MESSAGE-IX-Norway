3. Rebound effect: as all energy prices become cheaper, the demand for all energgy categories is linearly increased to 15 % in 2070.
4. inv_cost: nuclear, solar and wind costs decreased in order to reach around 50% of SSP2 in 2100, 5% decrease per year
5. fix_cost: nuclear, solar and wind costs decreased in order to reach around 50% of SSP2 in 2100, 5% decrease per year
